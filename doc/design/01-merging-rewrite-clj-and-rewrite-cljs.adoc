= Merging rewrite-clj and rewrite-cljs
:toc:
:toclevels: 6

== Introduction
Rewrite-clj v1 is a merge of https://github.com/clj-commons/rewrite-clj/tree/f515767e4f07f27389ee2885cb459bd87d903887[rewrite-clj v0] and https://github.com/clj-commons/rewrite-cljs[rewrite-cljs] giving us a one stop rewrite-clj shop for Clojure and ClojureScript developers.

== Goals
1. *Minimize API breakage*. Within reason, maintain API compatability with both rewrite-clj v0 and rewrite-cljs. I'd like rewrite-clj v1 to be an low friction replacement for `rundis/rewrite-cljs` (actually now living at `clj-commons/rewrite-cljs`) and `xsc/rewrite-clj` v0 (now living a clj-commons/rewrite-clj).
2. *Feature parity*. Rewrite-cljs has lagged behind rewrite-clj v0. Bring rewrite-cljs up to parity with rewrite-clj v0. Bring any rewrite-cljs specific features over to rewrite-clj v1.
3. *Preserve type hints*. I will respect and carry over existing type hinting in rewrite-clj v0 and rewrite-cljs. I will not, at this time, evaluate if existing type hinting has value.
4. *Improve documentation*. I think that rewrite-clj v0 documentation is good, but as I dig deeper into using the library and get feedback on Slack, I see places where guidance could be improved.
5. *Document design decisions*. I'm not sure what form this will take, but I do like projects that include histories of architectural and design decisions. Perhaps I'll adopt https://github.com/cljdoc/cljdoc/tree/master/doc/adr[adr ala cljdoc]. For now you can think of this document as I kind of sloppy-mega adr for my merge work.
6. *Modernize/update test/build*. Look at what is available today and make a choice.
7. *Define library version scheme*. Evaluate options, pick one and document.
8. *Find home for this work*. We have achieved the ideal here. Rewrite-clj v1 will continue from the same source repo as rewrite-clj v0.
We will also continue to deploy to clojars xsc/rewrite-clj. 

== Strategic Compromises
1. *Favor single code base*. I will favor a single code base over maintaining  http://rundis.github.io/blog/2015/clojurescript_performance_tuning.html[ClojureScript specific optimizations from rewrite-cljs]. These can be brought in at a later date if needed.
2. *Use generic exceptions*.  This is technically an API breakage, but I will switch to using the Clojure/ClojureScript agnostic `ex-info` for exceptions.
3. *Favor rewrite-clj features when there is overlap*. I currently only see one feature that overlaps between the two projects. rewrite-clj v0 and rewrite-cljs both have positional (row/col) support. Base positional support in rewrite-clj v0 is full featured and updates with any changes made, so we'll use it instead of rewrite-cljs's more primitive tools reader based positional support. This technically constitutes an API breakage for rewrite-cljs. We will, though, carry over rewrite-cljs's higher level positional functions.

== Changes
=== Breaking
. TODO: will likely hardcode this breaking change. +
Reader generated location metadata on coercion is now elided by default. +
Bind `rewrite-clj.node/\*elide-metadata*` to `nil` for rewrite-clj v0 behavior.
. TODO: namespace elements breakages
. Minimum versions
** Clojure v1.9
** Java v1.8
** ClojureScript v10
. Now using `ex-info` for exceptions
. Base positional support for rewrite-cljs has been migrated over to rewrite-clj implementation

=== Potentially breaking
1. Switched to `clojure.tools.reader.edn`
2. Potential performance hit for rewrite-cljs. Some rewrite-cljs specific optimizations dropped in favor of single code base.

=== Neutral
1. Docs now generated by cljdoc
** direct zipper functions (`right*`, `left*`, `up*`, etc) now show correct arguments.
** ``import-var``ed protocol functions now point to correct source code
** now using asciidoc
** now using markdown in docstrings
2. Continuous integration is now handled via GitHub Actions and adds testing
** on macOS and Windows operating systems
** for a GraalVM natively compiled rewrite-clj
3. Test tooling now uses:
** figwheel main for development cljs testing
** kaocha for clj testing
4. Switched from leiningen to tools cli `deps.edn`

=== Accretive

From what I perceive as public APIs, rewrite-clj v1 has gained:

[cols="3,1,3"]
|===
| public | origin | description

| rewrite-clj.node/\*elide-metadata*
| new
| metadata to omit, used by form-meta and coercion

| rewrite-clj.node/form-meta
| new
| same as clojure core meta but omits reader generated metadata

| rewrite-clj.node/node?
| new
| returns true if element is a rewrite-clj created node

| rewrite-clj.paredit
| rewrite-cljs
| API for structured editing of S-expression data

| rewrite-clj.zip/append-child*
| internal
| accidental omission from public API

| rewrite-clj.zip/find-last-by-pos
| rewrite-cljs
| positional search support

| rewrite-clj.zip/find-tag-by-pos
| rewrite-cljs
| positional search support

| rewrite-clj.zip/insert-newline-left
| internal
| accidental omission from public API

| rewrite-clj.zip/insert-newline-right
| internal
| accidental omission from public API

| rewrite-clj.zip/insert-space-left
| internal
| accidental omission from public API

| rewrite-clj.zip/insert-space-right
| internal
| accidental omission from public API

| rewrite-clj.zip/position-span
| rewrite-cljs
| positional search support

| rewrite-clj.zip/remove-preserve-newline
| rewrite-cljs
| same as remove but preserves newlines

| rewrite-clj.zip/subzip
| internal
| operate on a sub tree without affecting location
|===

And rewrite-clj v1 under ClojureScript (fomerly rewrite-cljs) has gained all of rewrite-clj v0's features except for the ability to read from files.

=== Detailed API diffs

I've used https://github.com/lread/diff-apis[diff-apis] to compare apis.
Normally I would have excluded any apis tagged with `:no-doc` metadata, but
because many folks used undocumented features in rewrite-clj v0 and rewrite-cljs, I
have done a complete comparison of all publics - except where noted . Each
report contains some observations under the "Notes" header.

=== Feature Differences
No ability to read from files when using rewrite-clj v1 from ClojureScript.

== Root namespace of `rewrite-clj`

Both rewrite-clj v0 and rewite-cljs share the same root namespace of `rewrite-clj`.

We'll happily continue with `rewrite-clj` for rewrite-clj v1 work:

. rewrite-clj v0 was transferred to clj-commons/rewrite-clj
. rewrite-clj v1 will carry on in clj-commons/rewrite-clj 
. we'll continue to use the existing rewrite-clj v0 clojar maven coordinates `xsc/rewrite-clj` for rewrite-clj v1 

== Projects Using rewrite-clj v0 and/or rewrite-cljs
I've tried to make note of popular/active projects that make use of rewrite-clj v0 and rewrite-cljs. 
I've linked where I've explicitly verified a migration to rewrite-clj v1.

== Projects Using rewrite-clj v1
We have at least one early adopter!: https://github.com/borkdude/carve[carve]

== Tooling

=== Build tools
I have moved from leiningen to tools cli and `deps.edn`. 
Like everything, this change has pros and cons. 
Overall, I like the simplicity and control it brings. 
Babashka scripts take the place of lein aliases where I can have the build do exactly what I want it to. 

=== Continuous integration
The future of https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] looked a bit tenuous when I started work on rewrite-clj v1.
I initially switched over to https://circleci.com/[CircleCI], but then when GitHub Actions became available decided it was a better fit:

* in addition to Linux, offers macOS and Windows testing in its free tier
* 7gb of RAM satisfies GraalVM's memory hungry `native-image`

=== Testing and linting tools
After looking around, I settled on the following for continuous integration:

. https://github.com/lambdaisland/kaocha[Kaocha] for running Clojure unit tests.
. moved from lein-doo to https://github.com/Olical/cljs-test-runner[cljs-test-runner] (which still uses https://github.com/bensu/doo[doo] under the hood) for running ClojureScript unit tests under node and chrome headless. 
I considered Koacha's cljs support and will reconsider when it matures a bit.
. I fail the build when a lint with https://github.com/borkdude/clj-kondo[clj-kondo] produces any warnings and/or errors.

During development, I found the following helpful:

. kaocha in watch mode for Clojure
. figwheel main for ClojureScript

== General Decisions

=== * Library version scheme - [red]*in progress*
I see plenty of version scheme variations out there these days. 
Here are a few examples I find interesting:

[cols="10,40,20,~",options="header"]
|====
|Project
|Scheme
|Example
|Observation

|https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript/releases[ClojureScript]
|major.minor.<commit count since major.minor>
|`1.10.520`
|Tracks Clojure version.

|https://github.com/borkdude/clj-kondo/releases[clj-kondo]
|yyyy-mm-dd-qualifier
|`2019.07.05-alpha`
|Freshness built into version.

|https://github.com/cljdoc/cljdoc[cljdoc]
|major.minor.<commit count>-<short git sha>
|`0.0.1315-c9e9a73`
|The short-sha safeguards against any potential confusion with duplicate commit counts for builds on different machines.

|https://github.com/noprompt/meander[meander]
|meander/<release> 0.0.<commit count>
|`meander/delta` `0.0.137`
|This scheme changes the artifact-id (for example gamma to delta) every time a potentially breaking change is introduced effectively releasing a new product for every breaking change.

|unimportant
|unimportant
|The alpha state is burnt into the project name and library namespace.
|====

Rewrite-clj v1 is not a new project. I feel the version should reflect at least some familiarity with its v0 scheme.

As of this writing the current version of rewrite-clj is `0.6.1`. I am guessing that the 0 is an unused version element, and we have a `0.major.minor` scheme.

Rewrite-clj is going to switch to a ClojureScript-ish scheme. +
It will use a `major.minor.<commit count since major.minor>-<qualifier>` scheme. +
Our first version will be `1.0.42-alpha` where `42` is just a wild guess right now.

An small awkwardness with this scheme is the change log. 
The change log should be part of the release but it does reference a git commit count. 
This, I suppose will be addressed locally with amended commits?

=== * Release Strategy - [red]*in progress*

TODO: think about the following...

We'll opt not to make SNAPSHOT releases and assume the community is good with testing pre-releases via
github coordinates. That said, I suppose opting out of SNAPSHOT releases means option out of testing
our release flow on successful pushes.

We'll keep a CHANGELOG.md carried on from rewrite-clj v0's CHANGES.md.

Not sure about release cadence yet. I expect to cut a release when I feel a pre-release has been tested enough.

TODO: Consider some sort of canary testing for a set of projects that make use of rewrite-clj. Examples that
come to mind: cljfmt, zprint, carve.

=== Source directory layout
When I first started to experiment with a cljc version of rewrite-clj, my directory layout looked like:

----
src/
  clj/
    rewrite-clj/
  cljs/
    rewrite-clj/
  cljc/
    rewrite-clj/
test/
  clj/
    rewrite-clj/
  cljs/
    rewrite-clj/
  cljc/
    rewrite-clj/
----

After a certain amount of work, I realized the majority of the code was cljc so opted for the much simpler:

----
src/
  rewrite-clj/
test/
  rewrite-clj/
----

===  Graalvm Support

Some command line tools written in Clojure are using Graal to compile to native
executables for fast startup times.

Others have done the work to test that rewrite-clj v0 can be compiled with Graal.
There is benefit to the community to test that rewrite-clj v1 can also be compiled to native code with Graal.

Noticing that there were differing approaches Graalifying Clojure, none of them centrally documented, @borkdude and I created https://github.com/lread/clj-graal-docs[clj-graal-docs] to develop and share scripts and tips.

My goal is to run the rewrite-clj v1 test suite from a graalvm native image to give some confidence that rewrite-clj v1 works after compiled with Graal.

==== Technical Issues

. Windows tooling requirements. Setup for running GraalVM jdk8 on Windows relies on old Microsoft tooling making setup
challenging.
. RAM requirements. GraalVM's `native-image` which creates the target executable, can consume a significant
amount of RAM.

==== Windows Tooling Requirements
I've decided that, for now, figuring out how to setup the proper tooling for Windows for GraalVM jdk8 is not worth my effort.
We'll continue to test on Windows but only for GraalVM jdk11.

==== Ram Requirements
I spent quite a bit of time trying to figure out how to overcome the RAM limitations of free tiers of continuous integration services.
Drone Cloud is the most generous with 64gb of RAM available but only supports Linux. 
CircleCI offers 3.5gb of RAM and is also Linux only in its free tier. 
GitHub Actions, offers 7gb of RAM and offers macOS, Linux and Windows.

I seriously explored two approaches:

. natively compile tests and library
. interpret tests via sci over natively compile library

If I had applied https://github.com/lread/clj-graal-docs#native-image-compilation-time[Clojure direct linking] earlier in my tests, I might have stopped at the first approach. 
For me, direct linking made approach 1 viable.

For now, I am testing using both approaches. 
Overviews can be found at https://github.com/lread/clj-graal-docs/blob/master/doc/testing-strategies.md[clj-graal-doc's testing strategies page].

== Questionable Decisions

=== Allowing garden style keywords

Borkdude is kind enough to ping me when there are issues with the internally forked version of rewrite-clj he uses for clj-kondo. 
It turns out that clojure.tools.reader.edn does not parse https://github.com/noprompt/garden[garden-style] keywords such as `:&::before`. 
The reader sees a double colon as illegal if it is anywhere in the keyword. 
Borkdude overcame this limitation by allowing a keyword to contain embedded double colons via a customized version of ``clojure.tools.reader.edn``'s `read-keyword` function.

I transcribed his work to rewrite-clj v1.

The maintenance cost to hacking a 3rd party lib is that upgrades will have to be carefully tracked. 
That said, we do have a good suite of tests that should uncover any issues.

=== Not allowing symbols with multiple slashes

While clojure reads `'org/clojure/math.numeric-tower`, `clojure.tools.reader.edn` barfs on this and therefore rewrite-clj does as well.

It has been documented as illegal for a symbol to have more than one `/`.

I have opted to not, at this time, adapt rewrite-clj v1 to allow parsing of this illegal syntax. 
This might seem a bit hypocritical because I did, some time ago, innocently https://github.com/borkdude/clj-kondo/issues/378[raise an issue on clj-kondo for
this].

== Clojure/ClojureScript Issues

=== ClojureScript namespace clashes
ClojureScript uses Google Closure under the hood. 
Because of the way Google Closure handles namespaces, some namespaces that work fine on Clojure clash under ClojureScript. 
Some rewrite-clj v0 namespaces clash for ClojureScript, for example:

* `rewrite-clj.zip/find`
* `rewrite-clj.zip.find`

The original rewrite-cljs author worked around this problem by renaming namespaces to avoid the clashes.

|===

None of these namespaces are part of public APIs, but because I see a lot of code that uses these internal namespaces, I decided to preserve the existing rewrite-clj v0 and rewrite-cljs naming for rewrite-clj v1.

=== Clojure/ClojureScript interop

* Where I felt I could get away with it, I localized Clojure/ClojureScript differences in the new `rewrite-clj.interop` namespace.
* Although technically an API breakage, I made a choice to switch all rewrite-clj v0 thrown exceptions to the Clojure/ClojureScript compatible ex-info for rewrite-clj v1.
* Some notes on differences between Clojure and ClojureScript
** throws and catches, if not using ex-info are different
** namespace requires cannot use shorthand syntax in cljs
** macros must (sometimes) be included differently
** IMetaData and other base types differ (this comes into play for us in coercion support)
** format not part of cljs standard lib
** no Character in cljs
** no ratios in cljs
** testing for NaN is different
** different max numerics

== Rewrite-clj/cljs Analysis

=== What is the public API?
rewrite-clj v0 purposefully only generated documentation for specific namespaces. 
It is reasonable to assume that these namespaces represent the public API:

* `rewrite-clj.parse`
* `rewrite-clj.node`
* `rewrite-clj.zip`

I am not sure why `rewrite-clj.custom-zipper` is included in the documented public API, because its functionality is exposed through `rewrite-clj.zip`, I expect this was perhaps an oversight, but might be wrong.

Because what is public versus what is private was not stressed strongly in the rewrite-clj v0 README, I frequently see private APIs used in code. 
For this reason, I've worked, within reason, not to break what I understand to be private APIs.

=== S-expressions
rewrite-clj allows parsed Clojure/ClojureScript/EDN to be converted back and forth to s-expressions.  
Example from a REPL session:

[source,clojure]
----
(require '[rewrite-clj.zip :as z])

(def zipper (z/of-string "[1 2 3]"))  ;; <1>
(pr zipper)
=stdout=> [<vector: [1 2 3]> {:l [], :pnodes [<forms: [1 2 3]>], :ppath nil, :r nil}]

(def s (z/sexpr zipper)) ;; <2>
s
=> [1 2 3]

(require '[rewrite-clj.node :as n])
(pr (n/coerce s)) ;; <3>
=stdout=> <vector: [1 2 3]>
----
<1> parse string to rewrite-clj nodes and create zipper
<2> convert rewrite-clj node at current location in zipper to s-expression
<3> convert s-expression to rewrite-clj node

While I expect this can be quite convenient, it does come with caveats:

1. What happens when we try to `sexpr` Clojure specific features from ClojureScript? 
For example, ratios are available in Clojure but not ClojureScript.
2. If you try to `sexpr` something that cannot be converted into an s-epxression an exception will be thrown.

My guidance is use `sexpr` in only in specific cases, where you know ahead of time what you are parsing. General blind use of `sexpr` is not recommended.

For rewrite-clj v1 itself, I have removed internal problematic uses of `sepxr` and documented some of its nuances.

=== Which reader?
Rewrite-clj makes use of Clojure's reader.  There are a few choices though:

1. `clojure.tools.reader`
2. `clojure.tools.reader.edn`
3. `clojure.reader`
4. `clojure/reader-string`

As I understand it, `clojure.tools.reader.edn` is the safest choice and I have updated rewrite-clj v1 to use it in all cases.

=== Potemkin import-vars
Rewrite-clj v0 makes use of a slightly modified version of https://github.com/ztellman/potemkin#import-vars[Potemkin import-vars]. 
The intent of import-vars is to make it easy to expose a public API from a set of internal namespaces.

When I first reviewed its usage in rewrite-clj, I found import-vars to be quite elegant. 
I have since learned that there is quite a bit of strong opinion in the Clojure community surrounding import-vars. 
Not all of it is rosy.

Also, there is no ClojureScript version of import-vars.

That said, I decided, at least for now, to honor the original rewrite-clj codebase and carry on with it. 
To be honest, this gave me the (the apparently too tempting to resist) opportunity to learn how to write a version of import-vars for ClojureScript. 

This led me to discover that while cljdoc did cope fine with import-vars trickery for Clojure code, it did not have any support for it for ClojureScript code. I made the necessary changes to cljdoc's fork of codox and subsequently cljdoc-analyzer. 

I also extended import-vars to rewrite-clj's purposes by adding a facility to rename imported vars and adapt docstrings.

All is not entirely rainbows and unicorns, we still may at some point drop import-vars if it causes rewrite-clj users grief.

=== Positional support
Rewrite-clj v0:

1. added a custom zipper to optionally track row/col within Clojure/ClojureScript/EDN files.
2. expresses positions as a `[row-number col-number]` vector.

Rewrite-cljs:

1. made use of the positional support provided by Clojure tools reader.
2. exposed a couple of functions to search by position.
3. expressed positions as a `{:row row-number :col col-number}` map

Because the positional support in rewrite-clj v0 tracks row/col even after zipper modifications, we use it in rewrite-clj v1 instead of rewrite-cljs's implementation.
We:

1. continue to support both rewrite-clj v0 vector and rewrite-cljs map notations for positions on function parameters.
2. use vector notation for position on function returns. 
I personally prefer the map notation, but, as a rule, favor rewrite-clj v0 over rewrite-cljs because rewrite-clj v0 is the more widely used library and thus changes affect more users.
3. include rewrite-cljs's positional functions: `rewrite-clj.zip/find-last-by-pos` and `rewrite-clj.zip/find-tag-by-pos` .

The most glaring breaking change for ClojureScript is that it must now create the zipper with positional support enabled, for example: `(z/of-string "[1 2 3]" {:track-position true})`
