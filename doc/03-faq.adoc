== Documentation

=== What is the meaning of the ^:no-doc metadata?
Our goal is to produce documentation for users of rewrite-clj. As such we only want to document public APIs.

`^:no-doc` is a signal to https://cljdoc.org/[cljdoc] that source code should not be included in generated documentation. This metadata convention was introduced by https://github.com/weavejester/codox[codox].

== What the markdown?
Stand alone articles are written up in https://asciidoctor.org/docs/what-is-asciidoc/[AsciiDoc].

1. it is a richer markup language than GitHub markdown.
2. is supported by cljdoc.

Our docstrings sometimes take advantage of https://commonmark.org/[CommonMark] which is supported by cljdoc for docstrings. GitHub uses CommonMark as part of of its markdown solution.
