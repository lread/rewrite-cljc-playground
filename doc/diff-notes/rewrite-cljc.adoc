The cljs and clj sides of rewrite-cljc have the following differences of note:

1. You'll notice that the clojure api has the ability to deal with files, the
   clojurescript api does not.
2. If we were to exclude api namespaces and functions marked with no-doc we
   link:rewrite-cljc-documented-only.adoc[would see only item 1 as differences].
   We include them because it seems that historically, internal undocumented
   features have been used in rewrite-cljs and rewrite-clj.
3. The clojure api has the extra namespaces that would cause collisions on the
   clojurescript side. These are all undocumented internal namespaces, but they
   have historically been used in rewrite-cljs, so they are included here for
   backwards compatibility.

TODO:

- string-node clj only?
