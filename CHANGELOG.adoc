== rewrite-clj v1
=== Unreleased

* link:doc/design/01-merging-rewrite-clj-and-rewrite-cljs.adoc[merged rewrite clj v0 and rewrite cljs]

== rewrite-clj v0

=== 0.6.0

* **BREAKING**: uses a dedicated node type for regular expressions. (see #49 –
  thanks @ChrisBlom!)
* implement `NodeCoercable` for `nil`. (set #53 – thanks @jespera!)

=== 0.5.2

* fixes parsing of splicing reader conditionals `#?@...`. (see #48)

=== 0.5.1

* fixes parsing of multi-line regular expressions. (see #51)

=== 0.5.0

* **BREAKING**: commas will no longer be parsed into `:whitespace` nodes but
  `:comma`. (see #44 - thanks @arrdem!)
* **BREAKING**: `position` will throw exception if not used on rewrite-clj
  custom zipper. (see #45)
* **BREAKING**: drops testing against JDK6.
* **DEPRECATED**:
** `append-space` in favour of `insert-space-right`
** `prepend-space` in favour of `insert-space-left`
** `append-newline` in favour of `insert-newline-right`
** `prepend-newline` in favour of `insert-newline-left`
* fix insertion of nodes in the presense of existing whitespace. (see #33, #34 -
  thanks @eraserhd!)
* `edn` and `edn*` now take a `:track-position?` option that activates a custom
  zipper implementation allowing `position` to be called on. (see #41, #45 -
  thanks @eraserhd!)
* fix parsing of whitespace, e.g. `<U+2028>`. (see #43)
* fix serialization of `integer-node`s. (see #37 - thanks @eraserhd!)
* adds `insert-left*` and `insert-right*` to facade.
* generative tests. (see #41 - thanks @eraserhd!)

=== 0.4.13

_Development has branched off, using the `0.4.x` branch_

* upgrades dependencies.
* fixes a compatibility issue when running 'benedekfazekas/mranderson' on
  a project with both 'rewrite-clj' and 'potemkin'.
* switch to Clojure 1.8.0 as base Clojure dependency; mark as "provided".
* switch to MIT License.
* drop support for JDK6.

=== 0.4.12

* drop `fast-zip` and `potemkin` dependencies. (see #26)

=== 0.4.11

* fix handling of symbols with boundary character inside. (see #25)

=== 0.4.10

* fix handling of symbols with trailing quote, e.g. `x'`. (see #24)

=== 0.4.9

* fix `replace-children` for `:uneval` nodes. (see #23)
* add `rewrite-clj.zip/postwalk`. (see #22)

=== 0.4.8

* allow parsing of aliased keywords, e.g. `::ns/foo`. (see #21)

=== 0.4.7

* fixes zipper creation over whitespace-/comment-only data. (see #20)

=== 0.4.6

* fixes parsing of empty comments. (see #19)

=== 0.4.5

* fixes parsing of comments that are at the end of a file without linebreak. (see #18)

=== 0.4.4

* upgrades dependencies.
* add `rewrite-clj.zip/child-sexprs` to public API.

=== 0.4.3

* fix parsing of backslash `\\` character. (see #17)

=== 0.4.2

* fix `:fn` nodes (were `printable-only?` but should actually create an s-sexpression).

=== 0.4.1

* fixes infinite loop when trying to read a character.

=== 0.4.0

* **BREAKING** `rewrite-clj.zip.indent` no longer usable.
* **BREAKING** node creation/edit has stricter preconditions (e.g. `:meta` has to
  contain exactly two non-whitespace forms).
* **BREAKING** moved to a type/protocol based implementation of nodes.
* fix radix support. (see #13)
* fix handling of spaces between certain forms. (see #7)
* add node constructor functions.
* add `child-sexprs` function.

- fix prewalk.
- add row/column metadata.

=== 0.3.9

* fix `estimate-length` for multi-line strings.

=== 0.3.7

* fix zipper creation from file.

=== 0.3.6

* added namespaced keywords.

=== 0.3.0

* added token type `:newline` to handle linebreak characters.
